# Node.js Kafka Example

This is the example repository for my [blog post](https://www.sohamkamani.com/nodejs/working-with-kafka/) on working with Kafka with Node.js.

To run the example:

1. Clone this repo
1. Configure the `brokers`, `clientId` and `topic` in the `producer.js` and `consumer.js` files according to where kafka is running on your system.
1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
1. Run `node index.js`

> You can see how to install and run a Kafka cluster in my [other tutorial](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/11/22/how-to-install-and-run-kafka/)
